## Project

User-interactive Sudoku game. Pseudo-random puzzle generator available.

### Assignment Description

Write a a program that creates a SudokuPuzzle and sets its initial configuration. Then use a loop to allow someone to play Sudoku. Display the current configuration and ask for a row, column, and value. Update the game board and display it again. If the configuration does not satisfy the restrictions, let the user know. Indicate when the puzzle has been solved correctly. In that case, both checkPuzzle and isFull would return true. You should also allow options for resetting the puzzle and displaying the values that can be placed in a given square. Puzzles should be randomized, and the user should be allowed to play multiple games and continue playing, until they want to exit.
